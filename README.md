# funset-build
Contains docker files for dev and production builds of the FunSet project

### Requirements
* Docker (https://www.docker.com/)

### Installation in development
You need to build the docker image from the provided DockerFile and Docker Compose. To do this:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/MLHale/funset-builds.git
cd funset-builds
git submodule sync
git submodule update --init --recursive --remote
cd backend/
git checkout master
cd ../frontend/
git checkout master
cd ..
docker-compose build
```

This creates a few docker containers with all of the requisite installed dependencies to run the dev environment.
Now initialize the new database:

```bash
docker-compose run django bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
# provide admin credentials
exit
```
### Development Environment Setup
If you plan to edit the client-side app, you need to,  upon initial install, build the ember dependencies. Do the following (on the host):

* install npm 6.0.0+
* install ember-cli 2.16.2 +

Then:

```bash
cd frontend/
npm install
```



### Running the ember app
The following commands compiles and pushes the latest client code to the server:

```bash
cd frontend
ember s
```

### Running the backend in development
You can run the backend server using the following (executed from the build directory):

```bash
docker-compose up
```
Now visit `localhost` in your host browser to view the app.

### Updating to latest versions of of the code
To update to the latest frontend and backend codebases, simply do the following to update the provided submodules.

```bash
cd frontend
git pull
cd ../backend
git pull
```
or type:

```bash
git submodule update --remote
```
### Deployment for production
For deploying the server to AWS EC2:

- deploy a new amazon ec2 ubuntu instance using the AWS Console
- install Docker and `docker-compose` on ubuntu
- do the following
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/MLHale/pathway-viz-builds.git
cd pathway-viz-builds/config/deployment
docker-compose up --build -d
docker-compose exec django bash
../../GOUtil g++ -O3 -o enrich enrich.C utilities.C --std=gnu++11
python manage.py createsuperuser
python loadterms.py -i data/<path to terms obo file>
python loadsimilarityscores.py -i

```

## Collaborating on this project
To prevent merge conflicts, always make sure you are working on a git branch. Read more about git branching here: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging
For an overview of useful git commands, visit: https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf

To create a new branch in each repo, navigate to the parent directory:
```bash
cd <path to this project directory>
git pull
git branch <yourname>-<feature-name>
cd backend/
git pull
git branch <yourname>-<feature-name>
cd ../frontend/
git pull
git branch <yourname>-<feature-name>
```
It is good practice to name the branch using a combination of your name and the feature you are working on. For example ```git branch mlhale-userinterface``` might be an acceptable branch name.

### When to make a pull request
Once you have finished developing whatever feature you are working on, make a pull request. To make a pull request, use the github web or desktop interfaces to select where the pull request targets (usually the ```master``` branch).

## Monitoring containers
If desired, you can view the performance of containers using the google cAdvisor project (see https://github.com/google/cadvisor).

To run do the following:
```bash
docker pull google/cadvisor:latest
sudo docker run \
  --volume=/:/rootfs:ro \
  --volume=/var/run:/var/run:rw \
  --volume=/sys:/sys:ro \
  --volume=/var/lib/docker/:/var/lib/docker:ro \
  --publish=8080:8080 \
  --detach=true \
  --name=cadvisor \
  google/cadvisor:latest
```

Now visit ```localhost:8080``` or ```<ip>:8080``` to view the current performance. You should see monitoring tools that resemble:
